India, a country with diverse water bodies ranging from mighty rivers to small streams, faces significant challenges in maintaining water quality. The quality of water varies drastically across different states and union territories due to factors such as industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage. This comprehensive analysis examines water quality on both a state-wise and river-wise basis across India.

Water quality is a critical aspect for both drinking water and marine life, as various parameters significantly impact the suitability of water for these purposes. Here are the key parameters and their typical acceptable ranges or conditions for both drinking water and marine life:

Drinking Water Quality Parameters

Temperature:
Generally should be ambient and consistent. High temperatures can affect taste and increase the growth of microorganisms.

Dissolved Oxygen (DO):
Drinking water should have a DO level of at least 5-6 mg/L. Higher levels are better as they ensure freshness and maintain taste.

Potential of Hydrogen (pH):
The pH of drinking water should be between 6.5 and 8.5. This range ensures that the water is neither too acidic nor too alkaline.

Conductivity Level:
Should be below 400 µS/cm. High conductivity indicates elevated levels of dissolved salts, which can affect taste and health.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):
Should be less than 2 mg/L. Low BOD indicates low levels of organic matter and good water quality.

Nitrate (NO3-N):
Should be less than 10 mg/L to avoid health issues, particularly for infants (risk of methemoglobinemia or "blue baby syndrome").

Nitrite (NO2-N):
Should be less than 1 mg/L. Higher levels can cause health problems similar to those caused by nitrates.

Fecal Coliforms:
Should be absent in drinking water. Their presence indicates contamination by fecal matter and potential pathogens.

Total Coliforms:
Should be less than 1 CFU/100 mL. Total coliforms are used as indicators of overall water sanitation quality.


Marine Life Water Quality Parameters

Temperature:
Varies depending on the species and habitat. Generally, marine life thrives in water that is within the natural temperature range of their environment.

Dissolved Oxygen (DO):
Should be at least 5 mg/L. Lower levels can cause stress or mortality in marine organisms.

Potential of Hydrogen (pH):
Should be between 7.5 and 8.5. Marine organisms are sensitive to pH changes, which can affect their metabolism and reproduction.

Conductivity Level:
Varies widely depending on the marine environment. Generally, marine water conductivity is higher due to the presence of salts (typically around 50,000 µS/cm).

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):
Should be less than 5 mg/L. Higher BOD can deplete oxygen levels, affecting marine life.

Nitrate (NO3-N):
Should be less than 0.1 mg/L in open marine waters. Higher levels can lead to eutrophication, affecting the marine ecosystem.

Nitrite (NO2-N):
Should be less than 0.02 mg/L. Nitrite is toxic to marine life, even at low concentrations.

Fecal Coliforms:
Ideally, should be absent, especially in areas where marine life is harvested for human consumption. Their presence indicates contamination and potential health risks.

Total Coliforms:
Should be minimal, particularly in sensitive or protected marine areas. High levels indicate pollution and can affect the health of marine ecosystems.


Sample datasets were collected from NITI Aayog’s website, including information on rivers, minor rivers, lakes, ponds, tanks, canals, drains, and groundwater. Out of the two datasets available, the source datasets were used to draw insights about water quality for various main water tributaries and their minor branches, as well as other water bodies such as tanks, canals, and drains. The quality of groundwater was analyzed on a state-by-state basis, considering factors such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrates, nitrites, and the presence of fecal coliforms and total coliforms.
