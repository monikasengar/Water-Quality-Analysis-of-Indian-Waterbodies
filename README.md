Sample datasets were collected from NITI Aayogâ€™s website, including information on rivers, minor rivers, lakes, ponds, tanks, canals, drains, and groundwater. Out of the two datasets available, the source datasets were used to draw insights about water quality for various main water tributaries and their minor branches, as well as other water bodies such as tanks, canals, and drains. The quality of groundwater was analyzed on a state-by-state basis, considering factors such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrates, nitrites, and the presence of fecal coliforms and total coliforms.
